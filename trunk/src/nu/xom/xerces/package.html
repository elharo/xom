<p>
<code>nu.xom.xerces</code>  contains
classes used to adapt the 
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/">Xerces</a>
 SAX parser for use with XOM. The primary effect is preventing
 the parser from accepting XML 1.1 documents. XOM is not designed to 
 handle XML 1.1. This is a feature, not a bug. You do not need to use 
 XML 1.1 and should not use XML 1.1. If you have any questions about this 
 see the <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM/faq.xhtml">FAQ</a> or
<a href="http://cafeconleche.org/books/effectivexml/chapters/03.html">Item 3 
of Effective XML</a>. Most users can safely ignore this package. 
The only reason you might need to refer to it is if you want to set some 
SAX features or properties on the parser before creating a 
<code>Builder</code>. In this case, using <code>XML1_0Parser</code>
 instead of <code>org.apache.xerces.parsers.SAXParser</code> will be somewhat 
 more efficient, though it won't have any effect on the result.
