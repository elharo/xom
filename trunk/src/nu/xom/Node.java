     *      from the same entity has an <code>xml:base</code> 
     *      attribute, then the value of that attribute from the
     *      nearest such ancestor is converted from an IRI to a URI, 
     *      absolutized if possible, and returned. 
     *      <em><code>xml:base</code> attributes from other entities are
     *      not considered.</em>

     *      Otherwise, if <code>setBaseURI()</code> has been invoked on 
     *      this element, then the URI most recently passed to that method 
     *      is absolutized if possible and returned.
     *    </li>
     *    <li>
     *      Otherwise, if the element comes from an externally
     *      parsed entity or the document entity, and the 
     *      original base URI has not been changed by invoking 
     *      <code>setBaseURI()</code>, then the URI of that entity is
     *      returned.
     *    </li>
     *    <li>

     *      rather then being parsed from an existing document), the
     *      base URI of the nearest ancestor that does have a base URI
     *      is returned. If no ancestors have a base URI, then the
     *      empty string is returned.
     *    </li>

     *   <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlbase/">XML
