<code>nu.xom.samples</code> includes several dozen example programs that 
demonstrate different parts of the XOM API.
These are intended for tutorial purposes. They are not designed as reusable code
for the most part. Most of the examples are adapted
from <cite><a target="_top"
href="https://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/">Processing XML with Java</a></cite>
by Elliotte Rusty Harold. Please consult that book 
(available in its entirety online) if you'd like more information
about what particular samples are intended to show.
That book  provides SAX, DOM, and/or JDOM implementations
of most of these samples. 
</p>

<p>
  These classes are not officially part of the XOM API.
  They have not been extensively tested, and I make no promises
  that they will be part of any future XOM release; or, if they are, 
  that their APIs will remain compatible. 
  Should you find any of them useful and wish to use them in your
  own code, I recommend you copy the source code, and place it in your
  own package. It probably wouldn't hurt to add a lot of unit tests as well.
