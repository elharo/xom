  <!-- is this a design principle???? -->
  
<para>
   XOM is designed and implemented exclusively in Java.
   No efforts have been made to make it compatible with any other languages, nor are any likely to be.

<para>
  Perhaps in the future someone inspired by XOM may take the ideas and
  design principles to other languages such as C++, C#, Python, or Perl.
  However, I probably won't do it myself;
  and I suspect that anyone who does will pretty much need to start over from scratch,
  and adapt the principles to their language of choice as appropriate.
