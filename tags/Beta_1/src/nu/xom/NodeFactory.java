/**
 * <p>
 * Builders use a <code>NodeFactory</code> object
 * to construct each <code>Node</code> object (<code>Element</code>,
 * <code>Text</code>, <code>Attribute</code>, etc.) they add to the
 * tree. The default implementation simply calls the relevant 
 * constructor, stuffs the resulting <code>Node</code> object in a 
 * length one <code>Nodes</code> object, and returns it. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Subclassing this class allows builders to produce
 * instance of subclasses (for example,
 * <code>HTMLElement</code>) instead of the
 * base classes.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Subclasses can also filter content while building.
 * For example, namespaces could be added to or changed 
 * on all elements. Comments could be deleted. Processing
 * instructions can be changed into elements. An 
 * <code>xinclude:include</code> element could be replaced
 * with the content it references. All such changes must be 
 * consistent with the usual rules of well-formedness. For 
 * example, the <code>makeDocType()</code> method should not 
 * return a list containing two <code>DocType</code> objects
 * because an XML document can have at most one document type
 * declaration. Nor should it return a list containing an element,
 * because an element cannot appear in a document prolog. However,
 * it could return a list containing any number of comments and
 * processing instructions, and not more than one <code>DocType</code> 
 * object.
